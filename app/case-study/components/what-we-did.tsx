              1. Surface Detection: Identifying surfaces with the most recent
              and precise AI algorithms.
              <br />
              2. Pattern Generation: AI creates intricately aligned and angled
              new surface patterns.
              <br />
              3. Image Integration: The process of fusing the freshly created
              surface with the original image of the room.
              <br />
              4. Post-Processing: adjusting the final picture to achieve harmony
              and realism, resulting in a visually pleasing and unified outcome.
