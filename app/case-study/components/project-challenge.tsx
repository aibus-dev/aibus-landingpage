                We collaborated with MateriView to improve their product
                visualization by utilizing GenAI. We produced a proof of concept
                (PoC) to validate the technology after they made their
                intentions clear. After that, we created and put into practice
                an approachable solution that integrated GenAI to provide
                realistic product renderings, enhancing the shopping experience
                and increasing user engagement.
