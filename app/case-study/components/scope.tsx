              We collaborated with MateriView to improve their product
              visualization by utilizing GenAI. We produced a proof of concept
              (PoC) to validate the technology after they made their intentions
              clear. After that, we created and put into practice an
              approachable solution that integrated GenAI to provide realistic
              product renderings, enhancing the shopping experience and
              increasing user engagement.
